                <p>I am driven by my commitments to usability, critical thinking, scalability, and accessibility when developing student learning experiences.</p> 
                <p>Open education, accessibility, critical pedagogy.</p>
                <p>Ethical uses of technology and data</p>
                <p>Universal design for learning</p>
                <p>I have taught and designed my own courses, both online and in person. During my doctoral program, I received pedagogical training and completed extensive course work in disability studies and social justice frameworks.
                I believe that technology can transform the ways we learn, connect, create, and process information, but also that learning goals should be at the center of all of technology decisions.
